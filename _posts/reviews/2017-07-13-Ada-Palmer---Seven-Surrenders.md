When judging Seven Surrenders, one can’t help but judge [Too like the Lightning]({% post_url reviews/2017-07-04-Ada-Palmer---Too-like-the-Lightning %}) as well. Because in fact, the two books should rightfully be a single volume. One can not exist without the other.

[TLDL]({% post_url reviews/2017-07-04-Ada-Palmer---Too-like-the-Lightning %}) is all about setting things up. It creates the world and its society, provides us with interesting characters, a mystery and a load of questions. Seven Surrenders, on the other hand, is a rollercaster ride of revelations and plot twist after plot twist.

While reading [TLDL]({% post_url reviews/2017-07-04-Ada-Palmer---Too-like-the-Lightning %}) I often was frustrated because of the writing or the convoluated, alien way things were arranged. BUT once you get used to it, your mind can sit back and enjoy the ride. [TLDL]({% post_url reviews/2017-07-04-Ada-Palmer---Too-like-the-Lightning %}) ends with a huge mystery and leaves you with so much questions. Thankfully, Seven Surrenders delivers answers in spades. Every chapter is beautifully carved, jumping from scene to scene, twisting the plot and the characters around and around, untill you no longer know which way is up, or who the good guy is supposed to be. You might think this is a bad thing, but I thorougly loved every minute of it.

This story takes some time and energy to get into, but once you’re familiar with the basic world building and have memorised who the cast is, it’s a rollercoaster ride of emotions.

LOVED THIS. 5 gazillion stars.
