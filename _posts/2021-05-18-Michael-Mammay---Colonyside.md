There's something weirdly magnetizing reading about Carl Butler doing his investigating and rubbing people the wrong way.

The way he thinks and analyzes EVERYTHING resonates with me, as well as his clipped, matter-of-fact way of talking and thinking.

This is the 3rd installment of the Butler-machine and I'm not getting bored of it. Reading this is like falling back in a comfortable rut and I loved every minute of it.
