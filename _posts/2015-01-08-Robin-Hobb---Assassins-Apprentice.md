Assassin’s apprentice has a very good story, a nice set of likeable characters and I greatly enjoyed reading it.

<!--more-->

The story feels epic and the author mercifully skips the more mundane parts frequently. Despite that though, it still feels like the whole thing should have a bit more action or move a bit quicker. The result is that the entire book feels like one big prologue to (what admittedly sounds like) an epic story-arc.

I’m invested in finding out how the story continues and have built good relationship with the main characters. So let’s hope that Royal Assassin brings a bit more action to the table, or I’m going to be seriously disappointed.

4 out of 5 stars because I can’t get over the pacing issue.
