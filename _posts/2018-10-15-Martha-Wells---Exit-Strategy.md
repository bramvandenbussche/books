The perfect ending to this mini-series.

<!--more-->

Murderbot has carved itself a little nook in my heart and it’s there to stay. This has been a great ride of action-packed short-stories constantly accompanied by the dry humor of murderbot critiquing everything and everyone (including itself).

I actually choked up a little near the ending, that’s how much it got to me. So Go Murderbot, Go!
