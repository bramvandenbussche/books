Overal I liked Blood of Innocents. It has a good story and the pacing is quite allright. It wasn't an amazing experience for me, but I can imagine that it is, for other people. I can see the potential, but for me, there were a few things that kept bugging me throughout the entire book and those kept me from really becoming immersed in the story (like what [Sanderson](../_authors/brandon-sanderson.md) books do for me).

Let me sum those real quick, before I forget them:

- For 80% of the book Caldan goes on and on and on about healing Miranda without ever stopping to wonder why he feels this way. I get it, he's deeply in love with her but too blind to actually see that, but he's constant whining on the subject really grinded my gears.

- It might be the "coming of age" part of Caldan, but he's constantly going back and forth between being a total badass and a complete idiot (The latter part being very annoying, more than once I wanted to slap him around). The same goes for swinging between childish naivety and full-on paranoia.

In the end, I ended up liking Amerdan the most and cheering him on. He, at least, is an interesting character that doesn't need to phrase every thought, contrary to Caldans constant musings. (hello exposition much?)

Blood of Innocents reminded me a lot about Patrick Rothfuss's writing style, and I didn't really like that either, althouth that story also intrigues me enough to keep on reading.
