This was a bit of an odd duck. I usually really like Pratchetts books, but this one wasn't what I expected at all.

<!--more-->

The usual ingredients were there:

- quirky characters
- absurd humor
- metaphors that come to life
- social commentary
- philosophy

and yet, the overal story arc didn't really intrigue me. The whole time, I felt like I had missed something important that should make me care for the story more, but I never figured out what it is.
It was still entertaining enough but not as amazing as I had hoped (and I really was in need of a good Pratchett novel).
