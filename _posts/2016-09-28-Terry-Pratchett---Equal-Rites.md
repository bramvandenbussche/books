I really enjoyed Equal Rites. The same Terry Pratchett humor is still there, but it’s not as difficult to follow as the colour of magic. His humor makes more sense and the political and social satirical undercurrent adds to it.

Granny Weatherwax is an awesome character. I’ve never highlighted so many funny phrases as I did in Equal Rites.

The only letdown for me was the quite lengthy and often boring mid section where Eskarina grows up. -1/2 a star off for that.

Final rating 4.5 / 5
