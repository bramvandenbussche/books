I've tried to gather my thoughts on [The Blade Itself](2014-02-03-Joe-Abercrombie---The-Blade-Itself.md) and [Before They Are Hanged](2014-02-13-Joe-Abercrombie---Before-They-are-Hanged.md) in order to write a review for them, and found that I simply didn't have much to say. Now that I've finished the trilogy I kind of have too ;)

I must say that I very much liked the ["First Law"-series]({{ site.baseurl }}/series/first-law.html). I loved most of the flawed characters, hated some others. Loved the character twists even more than the story twists. I'm glad that [Last Argument of Kings]() did not end at the end of the final battle, around 90%, but that the author took the time to write a decent aftermath story.

5 stars for the entire series, because the story really hooked me and made me gush for more.
