It's not a great book by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a fun, short read in a universe where death isn't usually permanent. Think of it more as a story-telling exercise to explore how you would murder someone when they can't really be killed in any conventional way, wrap that up in a mystery with some old familiars, and you've got [Murder by Other Means]().
