Oh my God, the cliffhanger! It pisses me off, to no end.

<!--more-->

The whole time, I had the feeling that this book was suffering from the "middle book" syndrome, as it had multiple sub-plots develop, intertwine and resolve, but near the end, around  the 80% mark, everything seemed nice and wrapped up, but wait, don't get your hopes up, Taylor shakes everything up and then ends it! She did put a nice little bandaid on it at the end, but still, it hurts that I now have to wait for the next one to resolve all my feelings.

All that said, I loved it. From start to finish, it was a great ride, with lots of dry humor and plenty of excitement. 5 stars!
