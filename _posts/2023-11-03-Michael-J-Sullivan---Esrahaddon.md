Really enjoyed my (long) time with this book.

Esrahaddon brings an end to the long and epic tale of the world of Elan, which started many years ago in [Theft of Swords](2013-10-14-Michael-J-Sullivan---Theft-of-Swords.md) with Hadrian & Royce, and I'm happy to have been part of the journey.

Michael J. Sullivan is a masterful storyteller and a great writer. Every single one of his protagonists is unique and lovable and Esrahaddon is no different.

I loved this book so much in fact, that I'm starting a re-read of the Riyra Revelations that started it all for me.
