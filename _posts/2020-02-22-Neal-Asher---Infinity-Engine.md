This concludes the Transformation Trilogy and to be honest, I'm feeling quite relieved that it's over.

<!--more-->

Which isn't to say that this is a bad book or a bad series. It is not. It was a series that took its time, built up slowly, had plenty of action and diverse (but not crowded) set of characters. There's an epic storyline that has an epic conclusion, and still I'm relieved it's over.
Mainly, I think, because it all just takes so damn long, and even though there's plenty of high-pace action scenes, it still just felt like it flowed the whole time, just flowed, a slow ebbing. It took me over 3 months to complete this and maybe that's the reason ?

I'm still giving it 4 stars, because it really has everything to be awesome, but something about the flow just irks me.

(I know I'm not being very coherent here, but let's just agree to let this one slip)
