I really thought [Peter Tr](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35342421-peter-tr) was exaggerating when [he said](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1560117792?book_show_action=false):

> You know you are reading a masterpiece when out of 95 chapters and 5 different POVs, not even one is slightly boring.

But it turns out, he couldn't be more right. Not one of the chapters can be described as 'boring'. They all have plenty of action or things happening to captivate the attention of the reader.

There's a very interesting, and well thought out magic system in place, of a quality I haven't seen since Sandersons Mistborn series.

The writing is exceptional and the characters are all interesting. The only problem I had was with a member of the main cast: Kip. I did not like him AT ALL.

Moreover, not liking a character isn't inherently bad, but his sudden bursts of 'genius' or 'power' didn't add up with his incompetent and stupid behavior the rest of the time. His witty self-criticism, albeit funny, doesn't match the stupid things he says and does. On the other hand, Brent Weeks did manage to portray his broken psyche pretty well, and kudos for not having an athletic adonis as a main character for once.

I would give this 5 stars, but I'm taking half a star for Kip, who annoyed me from start to finish.

Final verdict: **4.5 stars** and eager to continue.
