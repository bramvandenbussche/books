I think this is the 7th or 8th Discworld novel I've read, the 5th on the City Watch and I'm still a huge fan.

<!--more-->

I was really happy to focus on Vimes again, with his usual aplomb, he's absolutely suited for Diplomacy. I'm a tad sad that Angua didn't get more page-time, despite being an important part of the storyline, but I was happy to settle for some Carrot instead. Although I hope to see more of the secondary characters in the future.

Hillarious as usual, 5 easy stars.
