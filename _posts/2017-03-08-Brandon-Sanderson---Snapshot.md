Well that was a good read. There was a very cool premise, but not taken too far to feel alien.

It's a rather nice approach to time travel. There was an interesting chemistry between the 2 main characters and the story was actually suspenseful at times. The plot twist a the end was rather fun, even though not entirely unexpected. All in all, a very entertaining short story.
