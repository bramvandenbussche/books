I absolutely *loved* this book, and now I feel bad because I put of reading it for so long, just because I didn't really like the cover... shame on me!

The story is intriguing, a blend of the godfather meets oceans eleven with a pinch of italian spices to keep things interesting.

The writing style was sublime. I loved the way the narration seemed to continuously flow. The integrated flashback scenes were spaced nicely and added a lot to the story.

The author manages to put down very convincing characters and I found myself quite attached to them after a while.

This book is definitely worth 5 stars and can count itself among my all time favorites.

Highly recomended!
