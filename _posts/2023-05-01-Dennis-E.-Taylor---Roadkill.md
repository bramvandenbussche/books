I don't know what I expected from this book. It certainly wasn't what I got.

Roadkill isn't a bad book. It's the entertaining story of a couple of 20-somethings accidentally stumbling on an alien sneaking about, finding an invisible flying spaceship, uncovering a vast alien conspiracy to take over the world and consequently saving the human race.

If all that sounds a bit clich√© to you, that's because it is. This whole story read like a fan fiction written by a nerdy teenager, bored in his room. I know that sounds harsh, and I don't mean too. As I said, not a bad book, it's just a little "simple" and "straightforward" for my tastes. The story has some twists and turns, but nothing to major. Everything is nicely thought out and the ending rounds everything up nicely, with a bow on top.

It didn't help that it's narrated by the same guy that did the [Bobiverse](../series/bobiverse.md) series and I kept imagining instances of Bob instead of the characters.

Maybe I'm just too cynical but while Roadkill was entertaining, it was entertaining in a cheesy popcorn way, as if the book was actually written voor teenagers and not adults. The funny thing is that I would have totally loved this book... 20 years ago. So I'll leave it with a 3.5 star rating. It's not bad, just not for me.
