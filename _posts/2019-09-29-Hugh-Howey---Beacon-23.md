This wasn't entirely my cup of tea.

<!--more-->

All the major points are here, it's sci-fi with war and aliens and such, but it's all just backdrop to the PTSD of a former soldier playing lighthouse keeper in the middle of nowhere. Which, apparently, isn't something I particulary enjoy.

Other than that, the writing is good, maybe a bit too trying at times, but overall good. Narration and pacing are fine as well. All in all, a pretty solid read, just don't expect much action. Most of the book is introspection and narration of past events. Kind-a like [The Martian](2016-11-15-Andy-Weir---The-Martian.md) but with a PTSD-striken Matt Damon and nothing at stake.

3.5 stars.
