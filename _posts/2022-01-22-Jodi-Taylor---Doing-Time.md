I liked Hard Time. I really did, I enjoyed spending time with this story.

Doing Time combines Taylor's excellent storytelling with another side of her fantastic St. Mary's series, namely the Time Police. Using Matthew Pharrell as the link between the two she has created a heart warming adventure of 3 recruits being their weird self in a military like organisation.

This series, and the St. Mary's one really are my comfort food.
