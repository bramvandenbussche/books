Max hurtles up and down the timeline again. Handling the life of a -bounty hunter- recovery agent like a pro, juggling Insight, St. Mary's and the Time Police all at the same time. 

This story had me on the edge of my seat for most of the time, following right on the footsteps of the previous book, which ended on a massive cliffhanger. This one however, manages to wrap up everything incredibly nicely, with a pretty bow on top.

Loved every minute of it.
