Witches Abroad is exactly like I expected. Great fun.

This time around Pratchett takes us on a journey when the 3 witches decide to pick up “Fairy Godmotherin'” and travel the width of the land to prevent some girl from marrying some prince for some reason. Along the road they hit all the required sites, including Dracula’s castle and a little village that has a striking resemblance to Pamplona city.

Once again there are plenty of hillarious interactions, superb personifactions and loads of metaphor molesting to go around. At one point I tried counting the ‘jokes’ that make up this story and I concluded that you’d be hard pressed to find 2 consecutive lines without one, so I just gave up and enjoyed the ride. You should to 🙂
