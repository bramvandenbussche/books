I enjoyed The Shadow Throne more than I enjoyed The Thousand Names, and I think that thatâ€™s mainly because this book has a lot more sense of direction. About 1/3rd of the way in, you get a pretty good idea of what the end game will be, where the story is going. This helps a lot to feel like the plot is actually going somewhere in stead of meandering about from one scene to the next.

There was a lot less fighting and military stuff happening, which I could appreciate. The writing is still strong and interesting and the characters are fascinating and unique. Itâ€™s quite refreshing to have female protagonists that are not just extensions of the men in the book. They bring their own views and characteristics to the table to make for a different experience than what Iâ€™m used to. This also means that Iâ€™ve rolled my eyes quite a bit at all of the emotional stuff thatâ€™s going on, which would have been handled quite differently if the characters were men. Letâ€™s stick with calling it interesting ðŸ™‚

On to the conclusion of the trilogy, Iâ€™m glad to know which direction the end game is going to be in.

Also, as it turns out, Iâ€™m a sucker for a good sword fight (or a magic fight). Musket fights like these are not all that appealing to me. Donâ€™t get me wrong, the writing is great, it brings the necessary suspense and makes you feel like youâ€™re actually standing in the middle of the battle. It just doesnâ€™t feel very interesting to me personally. Maybe it just has to grow on me?
