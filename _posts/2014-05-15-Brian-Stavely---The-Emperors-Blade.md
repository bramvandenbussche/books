I don't get how this book manages to get a 4.2 star average on Goodreads. It makes me feel like I must have missed something crucial, something colossal, something so amazing that makes this book shine and stand out from the crowd. The main reason I even picked it up was because of the Goodreads 4+ stars rating, that, and the pretty cover.

I really tried to like this book, I tried searching for deeper meanings, to find something in the characters and/or their relationships that made it all worthwhile. Unfortunately this book let me down.

The story during the first 75% is slow, and I mean REALLY slow. Nothing much happens, some basic story lines get set up, something about a conspiracy, but for the most part, it reads more like a day-to-day diary of 2 guys that are not in a very exciting place. The Kettral, at least, add a little bit of flavor to the story, but the chapters where we follow Kaden are just plain boring.
During the last quarter of the book the pace finally starts to pick up, but it never really gets going, and before you know it, it's over and it leaves you with a feeling of 'is that it?'. The ending does not redeem the excrutiating pace of the first 3/4 of the story.

The characters are pretty flat and non-interesting and they didn't appeal to me at all. They feel like they could get a lot of depth, but it's just out of their reach.

The writing style was adequate, but nothing that really jumps out.

Overall, the 2-star rating of 'it was ok', pretty much sums it up for me. I might pick up the sequel when it comes out, but I might just as well not. Time will tell.
