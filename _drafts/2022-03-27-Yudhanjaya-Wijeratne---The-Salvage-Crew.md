## World-building

## Characters

## Story

The story reads a lot like something coming out of the fabled story-generator [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com). Let me elaborate, in Rimworld you have a small group of people that ~~crash~~ land on an alien planet. You need to set up a base of operations consisting of sleeping quarters, food operations and defenses from native wildlife and bandits, all before starting to scavenge/retrieve pieces of a starship that crashed here some time ago. You can only leave the planet once you complete this goal. Most of the ~~game~~ story consists of handling the moods and interactions of your crew as the ~~player~~ Overseer. They will fight, fall in love, grumble, have mental breakdowns, get sick, get wounded, etc..

Rimworld is a game where the destination (reaching your goal and leaving the planet) is not what it's about. It's the journey, the story that you create, that matters. As ~~the player~~ Overseer, you get attached to the humans entrusted to you, and you want to keep them alive, fed and happy, while still keeping the end goal in mind.

I don't know if the author knows about [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com), if that's where he got his idea, or that the similarities are just plain coincidental, but no matter which one it is, I **love** [Rimworld](https://rimworldgame.com) and I very much enjoyed the story as well.
