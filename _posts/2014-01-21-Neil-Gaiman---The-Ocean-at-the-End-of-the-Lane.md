I'm impressed with this book, very impressed.

<!--more-->

The story reads like a children's story, complete with crazy tent-like monsters and witches. On the other hand I find that the story is full of hints at something else, at a lost childhood, at bare feet in grass and not a care in the world. Contrary to most 'fantasy' books, [The Ocean at the End of the Lane]() does not strive to explain all that happens, it doesn't require the reader too. This causes you to be sucked in for the ride like a happenstance witness to events, and what a ride it is.

Apart from the story, the writing style definitely is up to par with some of the best I've read so far.

The Ocean at the End of the Lane really made me think back to my own childhood, using smart analogies and specific events, wordings, phrases, the author manages to make me feel like a kid again, and experience the wonders of his story.

I'm inclined to give this 5 stars just for what it did to me, regardless of the rest of it, but luckily, "the rest of it" is also worth every bit of that rating.
