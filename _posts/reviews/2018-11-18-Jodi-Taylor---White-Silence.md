Well this was a weird one.

I liked it though. I liked it a lot.

Let’s get into the nitty gritty.

## Characters

This book has all the hallmarks of a Jodi Taylor novel and it wasn’t hard to find the parallels between the main characters here and the ones in the St. Mary’s series.

Our protagonist, Elizabeth Cage, feels a lot like a boring version of Maxwell and the ‘Mountain’ Jones seems a carbon copy of Leon. Good, strong, dependable Leon.

That isn’t to say I didn’t like them. Everything
