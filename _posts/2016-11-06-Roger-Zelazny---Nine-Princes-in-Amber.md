Re-reading this after more than 15 years since my last read-through. Doing so with stories you loved is always a dangerous undertaking as this could turn out ruining those glorious, nostalgic, memories you've carried with you all this time.

After all, I'm a different person than I was in high school, back when I read the story of Corwin for the first time. The only thing I remember from that is that I absolutely loved this series and that it had something cool to do with magic playing cards.

But thankfully I loved [Nine Princes in Amber]() from start till finish. It's not your typical fantasy book where everything is neatly explained to you with large portions of exhibition dialogue, but for once, I'm glad that things aren't made obvious from the start. Even now, after having finished part 1, there's so many things that aren't made clear, or that aren't even talked about, and I'm ok with that.

The writing is odd and great at the same time. The strictly first person perspective is a bit jolting for me, as I'm used to switching often between characters' POV, but I got used to it pretty quickly;

For me, it's old nostalgic memories relived, and I haven't regretted it once.
