[The Hand of Oberon]() very much picks up the pace where [Sign of the Unicorn](2016-11-12-Roger-Zelazny---Sign-of-the-Unicorn.md) left off and marches on at brakeneck speed. A lot of things happen and the plot hurls forward, to finally end with an epic showdown and spectacular revelation.

Very much enjoyed this and now onwards to the final installment of the Corwin cycle!
