The story of our unlikely heroes continues, with more shit & piss humor, more "yo momma" jokes, more swearing and more sexual inuendo.

There isn't all that much too say about this, as it's the exact same experience as the first one. Not very intellectual, funny in a juvenile kind of way, highly entertaining if you like this genre and overal just a fun romp.

Kudos for the narrator that did the audiobook. He does incredible voices which makes the whole thing so much more fun.
