Wow. Just.. Wow. That last paragraph literally had me exclaiming a “WTF?”. I did NOT see that coming, at all. And now I’m stuck, wanting more, but being confined to waiting for the release of the next part. Mental note to self: STOP reading series where the ending hasn’t been written yet!

The ending of The Daylight War just leaves me with my jaw dropped to the floor and a feeling of “Did just happen? o.O”. I frickin’ loved this book, from the characters to the vocabulary of the Hollowers.

This series should be turned into a television series and/or game asap.
