This is about the same kind of book as [Traitor's Blade](2016-09-24-Sebastien-de-Castell---Traitors-Blade.md) but with less fairy tale elements and tropes, and because of that, I liked it better than [Traitor's Blade](2016-09-24-Sebastien-de-Castell---Traitors-Blade.md).

The characters feel real enough to evoke emotion in me, and the writing is still very good. There's great humor to be found, and the story makes some nice twists and turns that, while not blowing me off my socks, still managed to keep me interested.
