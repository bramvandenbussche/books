Timing is everything, when it comes to reading books. I find that my opinion on some books is heavily influenced by what I've read in the months/weeks before. Maybe that is the case here as well. Having just finished the [Farseer Trilogy](../_series/farseer-trilogy.md) by [Robin Hobb](../_authors/robin-hobb.md), and not being all that impressed by it, I found [The Crown Tower]() to be just what I needed. The story is by no means very complicated, but the characters are well-rounded, witty and rememberable. It's been over a year and a half since I've finished [Heir of Novron](2013-11-10-Michael-J-Sullivan---Heir-of-Novron.md) but meeting up with Hadrian and Royce again was like rekindling an old friendship. The story is fast-paced, which I REALLY appreciated, but still leaves enough to not feel rushed.

I'll gladly give this 5-stars, for bringing me my joy back in reading.
