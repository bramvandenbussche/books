This wasn’t really my thing. It provides some backstory for Bobbie Draper, but her actual part in this is only minor and since I didn’t connect to the main character, it pretty much falls flat on its bottom for me.

<!--more-->

That isn’t to say that it’s badly written, or not worth your time, it’s just not something that stands out for me. This series has proven, so far, to be very good at what it does, and Gods of Risk just doen’t do that for me.

3 stars.
