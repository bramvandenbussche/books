Shadows Linger puts an even bigger strain on the readers moral compass than it's predecessor, and that's saying something.

<!--more-->

I must say that this book was a lot more readable than [it's predecessor](2014-06-01-Glen-Cook---The-Black-Company.md) too, it seemed to make up for a lot of flaws from the first part and actually showed some action and character development. Especially the main anchor guy, around whom the story hinges, Marron Shed, sees quite an impressive character arc throughout the story.

I'm not going to summarize the story in this review (that's what the summary is for), but it suffices to say that the story, again, ends with a big "this is not finished, go read the next part"-theme. It doesn't end in a cliffhanger though, and I can appreciate that. I'll pick up the last part of the trilogy and see if it can yet improve over this.

Also, on a sidenote, this book has, quite possibly, some of the worst cover art I've ever seen.

3.5 stars for entertaining me but not dragging me in completely.
