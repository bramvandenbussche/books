The start was great, with strong characters and a solid story to follow.

<!--more-->

The middle got a bit murkier, with multiple POV's and the relations not always clear. By the end it got even murkier but it all resolved clearly. Not sure if I'm the biggest fan of the ending but it was satisfying, in a way.

Great writing, great worldbuilding and great characters make this one a solid 4 stars.
