This is a weird one.

<!--more-->

A lot might have to do with the fact that this was written in the 60's and their vision of the future was a grim one, but still... There is so much lethargy going on that it constantly reminds me of that depressed robot in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

There's a lot of philosophy being thrown around about the value of life and what exactly constitutes life and how do android lifeforms fit in there, but there are no clear answers given. Something I did like, because I do like to form my own opinions on the matter, it did irk me though that our MC kept going back and forth on the matter and I had a hard time keeping up. That might have to do with the monotone tone this story has (or maybe it's just the narrator doing the audiobook) but everything was on the same level, whatever was happening, and it made it hard to follow.

I'm glad I read this, because I can see that a lot of sci-fi has its roots here, but as a book on its own, it wasn't outstanding. 3.5 stars.
