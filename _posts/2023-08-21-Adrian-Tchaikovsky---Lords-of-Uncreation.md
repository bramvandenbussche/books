What an epic conclusion to an epic tale!

<!-- more -->

I'm both thrilled with this book and a little sad that my time with these characters is coming to an end. They have entertained me for a long time and I've grown attached to them. Tchaikovsky really is a wonderfaul author. All these people have grown and changed throughout this story and most have endeared themselves to me. Even that clam bastard, Sortiel, the Razer and the Hook has gotten a permanent place in my memories.

It's rare to come across a trilogy of this scope where all the narrative threads get wrapped up so nicely, where the ending is bittersweet and yet incredibly fulfilling. I don't think I could have come up with a better way to end things. Given the scope of the story and the players, I mean, who would have thought that the Moon sized architects that can rend planets at will with little to no effort would wind up to be just a small cog in the machine, it's incredible that he still made the Human scale matter.

All in all, 10 out of 10. Great trilogy, epic scope, diverse cast and masterful storytelling make this a treat for every sci-fi fan.
