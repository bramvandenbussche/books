How do you fight the Gods? You ask the ~~Belgriclungreians~~ dwarfs for swords, of course, how else!

<!--more-->

This part of the series really gave me the feeling, even more so than [Age of Myth](2016-07-26-Michael-J.-Sullivan---Age-of-Myth.md), that you should read [the entire series](../series/../_series/legends-of-the-first-empire.md), and judge that as a whole, rather than rate the individual books.

Despite that, there are many things here that I truly liked and that essential for the greater overall series:

- The introduction of the Belgriclungreians and their culture
- The origin of Suri's hate for Gronbach
- Moya learning to work the bow and arrow
- Introduction of the creatures known as "Raow"
- The history of the Agave
- <spoiler>Suri sacrificing Minna and learning the secret of the Gilarabrywn</spoiler>
- <spoiler>MawyndulÃ«'s part in the Miralyith rebellion</spoiler>
- <spoiler>Suri taking down Nieth because Gronbach was being an ass</spoiler>
- <spoiler>Moya taking out the leader of the Gula-Rhunes before he even got 2 steps in</spoiler>
- <spoiler>Persephone being chosen as Keenig of all the Rhunes</spoiler>
- The history of Persephone and Raithe

[Age of Swords]() feels like a stepping stone, it's a logical segmentation of the story, but it's just a minor step in the direction of the bigger things that are yet to come. It's an impression that I can't shake while reading, the feeling that you just want to rush through the story, so you can get to the ~~good~~ better parts in the next book. Make no mistake, [Age of Swords]() is a great story in itself, having a proper start - middle - end, with unexpected plot twists, a proper story arc and a satisfying ending. It just **feels** like it's only leading up to greatness, instead of just **being** great.
