This series is a quintet; not a trilogy, as claimed in some media reports.

There are also a few novellas in addition to the main works. The last book in the series was published in October 2017.

As for the author's future plans in the Demon Cycle universe, Peter says: "I will continue writing in the Demon Cycle world for the foreseeable future. I have plans for several novellas, a couple of stand-alone novels, and—the thing I am most excited about—a new demon cycle series."
