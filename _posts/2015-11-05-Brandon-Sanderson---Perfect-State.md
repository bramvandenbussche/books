It's a short story, so it gets a short review.

<!--more-->

Perfect State feels like a hobby project for Sanderson, in between his bigger novels, it feels like a way of him letting off steam and just taking a crazy idea and going with it.

In typical Sanderson style, there's great world building, and great characters. The 'setup' is something that's influenced heavily by The Matrix, and ties that in with a Dystopian world.

I found myself really interested in the premise and enjoyed the (few) characters very much. A very solid, entertaining read.
