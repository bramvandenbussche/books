Well I totally did not expect to love this like I have. In retrospect it’s hard to put my finger on exactly what it is that does it for me. The story isn’t particulary filled with suspense or mystery, and yet I couldn’t put it down. I personally liked Bob and his dry commentary. There were boatloads of pop references of which most went straight over my head (hello Star Wars / Star Trek trivia ?), but for some reason that didn’t bother me at all.

I can see though, why some people might not like this. I really don’t think it’s just for everyone, but being a tech nerd myself, I found myself strangely compelled by all the things going on.

Looking forward to read part 2 & 3 in the coming months.
