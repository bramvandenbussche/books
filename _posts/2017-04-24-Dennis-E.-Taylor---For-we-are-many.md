I absolutely adored this. I laughed, I cried, it warmed my heart and broke it in places. My only grievance is that it’s too damn short for my liking. I could have read twice this and not have gotten bored.

Despite they’re being over 40 Bobs by the last page, at no time did I feel lost. There are plenty of POV’s intertwined with a half dozen storylines and I liked every one of them. There is just something about this series that speaks to my inner geek (okay, i’ll admit, in my case it doesn’t have to go very deep to find him) and it works for me, even though I only get half the geek-culture references.

5 stars, easy.
