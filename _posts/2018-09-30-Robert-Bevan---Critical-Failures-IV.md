Well, it's more of the same.

<!--more-->

There's a lot of poop and piss jokes and a lot of sexual inuendo but other than that, there's somewhat of a storyline with the party breaking up and every part going on its own little adventure, which is fun. The creation of Jesus Christ and the subsequent processing of that event is glorious though.

Quite fun, but still very juvenile. Still, I want to close this series, so I'm soldiering on!
