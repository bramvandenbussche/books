This would be my 3rd (yes, I know it’s technically the 4th, but I skipped one due to ignorance) Rincewind novel, and my 10th (or something) [Pratchett](../_authors/terry-pratchett.md) novel, and I find that I did not enjoy this as much as I have the other sub-series (Witches, the Guard, Death).

I think it has to do with the fact that the Rincewind novels are written more like a standard fantasy adventure, where we travel from place to place trying to stay alive. For some reason though, [Pratchett](../_authors/terry-pratchett.md)’s superb writing and witty humor are not up to the task of carrying the story entirely and I’m left feeling entertained, but not drawn in, like I have been with all the other Discworld novels I’ve read.

I’m going to go with 3.5 stars for this. I had plenty of laughs, but the story (and the characters) don’t feel very interesting to me.
