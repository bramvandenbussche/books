This is a short story in [the Expanse series](../_series/expanse.md) that tells the story of Solomon Epstein, and the origins of the Epstein drive.

Well, it’s interesting backstory, but not much else. The writing is the same, meaning good, but the story itself isn’t much to look at. It isn’t bad per se, just not very thrilling or exciting. It’s really short though, so I’d recommend reading it just to learn a little history.

3.5 stars.
