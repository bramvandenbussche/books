What to say ? Well, it’s a Discworld novel. That should give you a pretty good idea on what to expect. Once again it’s a delight to read (or listen to, in my case) with many, MANY clever quips and personafied items & metaphors. Granny Weatherwax was once again superb, and Nanny Og gave me many a laugh.

This series is starting to grow on me quite a bit. It’s a still you have to get used to, but once you do, every novel feels like coming home to a familiar hearth.

The excellent audiobook adds so much to the experience that I can heartily recommend it to anyone willing to give these novels a try.
