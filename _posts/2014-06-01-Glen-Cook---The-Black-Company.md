I just don't know what to make of this. Did I like it? Not particulary (I think?) Did I dislike it? Not particulary (I think?). I'm trying to find an angle to describe my feelings on this by reading other reviews and I find myself agreeing with all of them, be it 1-star reviews, 3-star or 5-star reviews. How the heck am I to rate it then?

I'll ponder over it some more, as I contemplate reading the next installment.
