Oh noes, Team 236 is splitting up? How can this be?

<!--more-->

What started of as a mundane assignment, specifically selected for its mundanity, quickly turns everyone's life into a veritable shitstorm.

I should admit that I didn't see this book coming. There's so much going on, in the short timespan of 24h (well, as short as 24h can be if time travel is involved) and so many intertwined plotlines and yet I tore through it in just a week or two. I love how Taylor manages to make Parish Senior even more likable book after book, despite making him look like the villain early on.

As usual the snark and wittiness is on point and it makes the sometimes heavy story line easy to digest. I love this series.
