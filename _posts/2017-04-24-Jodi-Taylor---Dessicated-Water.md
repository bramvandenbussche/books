It might be one page short, but Jodi Taylor still managed to make me laugh out loud. To anyone casually reading this, this short shorter (shortest?) story, it would seem that we have all lost our minds, because without the intimate knowledge of all the characters involved (and those referenced) all of the humor is lost. But for those who have devoured all the previous stories, and found that they were aching for more, this brilliant scene feels like a drop of water when you're stranded in the dessert and just about ready to kick the bucket.

I'll stop now, or the review will end up longer than the story...

5 stars for instantly teleporting me back to the crazy world that is St. Mary's.
