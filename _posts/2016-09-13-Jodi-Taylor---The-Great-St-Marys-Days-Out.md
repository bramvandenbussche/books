This had me laughing out loud so often that I lost count (which is saying something if the book only has 55 pages). Of all the short stories, this is definitely my favorite.

I’m saddened that, at least for now, the St. Mary’s sage comes to an end for me. It’s not often that saying goodbye to a series, a cast of characters you’ve come to know and love, is so hard. Fortunately there’s Christmas, and the release of My Name is Markham, to look forward to in a couple of months, followed by july, when Blood, Sweat, and Tea comes out.

St. Mary’s, goodbye for now , you’ll always have a place in my heart ♥.
