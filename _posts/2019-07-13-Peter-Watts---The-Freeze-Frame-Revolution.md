I must admit, before this book, I didn't know.

This right here was a short, fast thriller with a great sci-fi premise. How do you know who to trust? Who to talk too? When everything around is you is part of "The Ship" and therefor the _enemy_.

I really enjoyed this fresh take on colonisation travels and the unraveling of the mystery.

Highly recommended.
