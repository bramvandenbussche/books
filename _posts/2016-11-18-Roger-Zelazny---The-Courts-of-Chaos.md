Allright, there we have it, I've finished the [Corwin arc](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49385) of the [Chronicles of Amber](../_series/chronicles-of-amber.md) series.

[The Courts of Chaos]() is a non-stop adrenaline rush from start to finish. All the pieces are set for the end game, all players are known and ready, and it's time get things underway. I loved every bit of it. It's a fitting conclusion to an epic tale.

As usual when reading the last book in a series, I review the entire series as a whole, because often times, I find that my opinion of certain parts changes after I've finished the whole arc. So what did I think after re-reading everything after 15 years? I have to say that I absolutely loved it and that it does not in any way tarnish the shining memories I have from reading it back in the day. I don't have any basis for comparison, but I feel that I appreciate it all the more, now that I'm a little older.

The entire series gets 5 stars.
