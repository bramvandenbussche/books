Wow. What a rush.

<!--more-->

As good as [The Waking Fire](2017-07-30-Anthony-Ryan---The-Waking-Fire.md) was, this is even better, which isn’t a guarantee in the world of fantasy series. The narrative finally comes to full fruition and the epic scale of this tale becomes clear. It takes a while to get going, but once it does, it’s a rollercoaster ride all the way to the end. Bring on the next one!

5 stars, easy.
