I read this after reading [The Waking Fire]({% post_url reviews/2017-08-08-Anthony-Ryan---The-Legion-of-Flame %}), even though it’s a prequel, and I think that’s the preferred order. This short story is the full account of what happened on the Sands years prior to the events that took place in [The Waking Fire]({% post_url reviews/2017-08-08-Anthony-Ryan---The-Legion-of-Flame %}). It is in fact, the driving element for most of its sequel.

Coming in at only 27 pages, this was a very short short, but I still enjoyed it. It was most interesting to get the full account of what transpired, to fill in the gaps that are left open in [The Waking Fire]({% post_url reviews/2017-08-08-Anthony-Ryan---The-Legion-of-Flame %}).

The writing was good, the pace frantic, and the world building, slim as it is, is interesting.
