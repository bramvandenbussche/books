This is arguably the weakest part of the series.

<!--more-->

Our main protagonists Arlen & Jardir are off on their own and hardly get any screen time. The main focus this time around is on Royer & Leesa and the defense of the Hollow. Plot wise nothing much moved and I kept wishing the view would focus more on Arlen, but sadly it didn’t happen. I get that this book is setting up all the pieces for the final conclusion, but that just makes this feel like a lot of filler. Definitely not bad, but didn’t live up to my expectations.

Onwards to The Core (in 2017)!
