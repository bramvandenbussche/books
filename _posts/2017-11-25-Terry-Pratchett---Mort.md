This is the first novel in the Death cycle and I didn’t really know what to expect. I’ve met Death a few times in other novels, but this is the first book where we really learn about the personality behind the hood.

## Story

For some reason, Death needs an apprentice and he’s actually the main character throughout this novel. As usual, the story bends reality, space and time with a wiff of romance mixed in for good measure.

## World-building

Pratchett did a great job in creating Deaths estate and giving substance to the whole “Like sand through an hourglass, so are the days of our lives”-metaphor. Great stuff!

## Characters

Mort is a vey likeable character and following his shenanigans is a blast but in my opinion, Deaths mid-life crisis, interweaved with the main story, paints a great picture of this iconic persona.

## Writing

It’s a Pratchett novel, what do you expect? Hillarious as usual with metaphors that come to life and sentences that wriggle around like snakes in a pit. Beautiful prose.

## Conclusion

I loved every minute of this and will gladly read more of this!
