## Part III: Nyphron Rising & Part IV: The Emerald Storm

Things seem to get a bit more serious in this installment, but still the humor carries it through. The characters really grow on you.

I devoured this. This is so much fun!

Avempartha picks up right after The Crown Conspiracy and is a touch heavier on the storyline without losing it's light-hearted humor and terrific characters. Very entertaining, yes.
