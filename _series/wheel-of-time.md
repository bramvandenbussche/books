Written by Robert Jordan and completed posthumously by Brandon Sanderson, The Wheel of Time is one of the greatest epics of fantasy and a #1 internationally bestselling series. Taking place both in our past and our future, the saga tells the story of a man destined to face the Evil One and save the worldâ€”or destroy it in the process.

The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.
