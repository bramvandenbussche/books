Murderbot is back! With another existential crisis!

<!-- more -->

I enjoyed this book, but I have to admit that it's not the best one. It took me quite a while to get my bearings about who was there and what was going on. All the difficult names and players don't help with this.

Once I figured out what was going on, we were almost halfway through the story. As usual, excrement hits the rotating air pressure device and even though the story flows well, the action scenes felt a bit lacking to me. Maybe it's because we've seen most of it before, but I was hoping for more depth, both in story and in action scenes.

3.5 stars for not overstaying it's welcome, but I do hope the next one will deliver more on the premise.
