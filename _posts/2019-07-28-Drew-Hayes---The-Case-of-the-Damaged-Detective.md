I've put this one during a long road trip, to make the time pass faster without being too complex it would require all my attention, and it was perfect for it.

The characters are great, both the main and the side characters. The action felt good and the whole story flowed nicely, working up to a satisfying climax.

Narration was spot-on, but it did tend to get quieter at times, when specific characters spoke. All-in-all, a great read, highly recommended.
