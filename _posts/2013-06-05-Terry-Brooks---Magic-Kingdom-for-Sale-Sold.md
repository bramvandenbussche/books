I must say that this was so much fun to read. The whole story is full with lighthearted humor and likeable characters. It's not the grand fantasy that I usually read, but it just sucks you right in. I mean, a talking dog as a scribe? This is the kind of world I want to live in!

The main character, Ben Holiday, is such a nice, recognizable guy that I immediately felt connected to him. I really felt for the guy in his quest to claim the throne. It felt like every step of the way was another fight to just make it and I found myself cheering him on as he went. I think that is the strength of this story. It's one man's struggle to do what's right when the whole world is against him, and he does it in such a human way that you can't keep yourself from respecting him.

I must mention that I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style, with beautiful descriptions that made the world come alive and great wordplay in the dialogues.

Overal 4 stars, I really enjoyed it, but it's not up to the same level as what I personally enjoy the most.
