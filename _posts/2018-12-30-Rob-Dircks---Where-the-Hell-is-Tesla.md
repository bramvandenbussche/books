Well this was funny. Simple and predictable, but it managed to make a 5h car ride entertaining enough and the audiobook narrator was a real gem.

The story line read like it was written by the overimagination of a 12 year old that just learned about the multiverse. Entertaining, but a bit heavy on the deus ex machina's. Like a bunch of frat boys that stumbled into [the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy](2019-02-25-Douglas-Adams---The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy.md), but less witty and with a lot of 90's cheese vibe.

The writing style wasn't my cup of tea. Wrapping everything in email format got really old really fast with the audiobook, which has to read every single one email header.

All in all, we were entertained, but I won't be continuing with this series. 3 stars.
