I agree fully with what [Peter Tr](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1064628242?book_show_action=false) said in his review.

I really, really liked [Traitor's Blade]() but for some weird magic elements towards the end and some crazy deus ex machina moments that didn't add up for me. Therefor just half a star shy of 5 stars.

They should really make an audiobook out of this series. I've seen them make 'em for far worse books and this gem utterly deserves it.
