I’m going to keep it short, to make my point. This book is way to long. It only got interesting in the final few chapters, and even then it felt half-assed.

<!--more-->

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve yelled at the characters that they were being morons or idiots.

This was a long, boring read, following 2 other long, boring books where all the interesting bits are held back until the final chapters. This is just not for me.
