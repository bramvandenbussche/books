I really was hoping that I would like this series. It started off so promising in the first book, but this just dissapoints.

<!--more-->

It starts off really early in the game when one of the cheesiest plot devices is used to kickstart the story. Now, I'm willing to overlook this fact because the style of this series is focused on using all the available clich√©s in fantasy literature, where it not for the fact that the main character is a frickin' idiot.

The entire book I found myself yelling at him; "Don't go there", "Don't do that", "are you blind?", etc.. It was like a bad horror movie in which the main character does everything wrong but still doesn't manage to get him/herself killed.

Writing style is still good, though I did have a few laughs when it tries to take the story too serious. I stopped counting how many times Ben was so scared like [insert overly literate metaphor for fear here] never before. This guy literally goes through the entire book being somewhere between scared and scared shitless. There are a lot of "epic" descriptions that just don't fit with the story style.


The author gives you enough information to figure out the plot before you even reach halfway (which is frustrating), but what makes it worse is that Ben has the exact same information and still manages to stay dumbfounded till the very end.

To conclude: I did not like it, didn't hate it, but it just didn't please me either. I just got frustrated the entire time and I think the story is really weak and doesn't do Terry Brooks's writing any justice.
