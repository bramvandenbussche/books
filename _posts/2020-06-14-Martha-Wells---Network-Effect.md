This book is exactly what you would expect from a full-length Murderbot novel. It has solid writing, socially awkward constructs and even more awkward relationships with Humans. The humor is dry and witty and had me highlighting so much my ebook looks like a toddlers coloring book.

<!--more-->

The storyline is a mystery wrapped with human tension and lots of unknowns which keeps you reading on long past your bedtime.

I've given this book 4.5 stars in stead of 5 because despite being very solid on all fronts because it wasn't mind-blowing or very surprising. I did however love getting reacquainted with ART and meeting 3.
