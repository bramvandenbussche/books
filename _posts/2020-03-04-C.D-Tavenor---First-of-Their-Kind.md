I'm unsure how I feel about this book.

<!--more-->

Many sing its praises, and I was expecting to be blown away by it, seeing how I love a good AI story. However, I found myself often complaining that I was bored and that the story needed to get a move on. So, to me, there seem to be some pacing issues. Although that could also be explained by the book not living up to my expectations. I did not expect to find so much philosophizing and maybe therein lies the problem.
The premise in itself is cool, the character gender question was interesting too. There's even a story line to be had, which is quite good, if you look in between the philosophizing.

On the whole, this book is unbalanced for me and I would have had greater enjoyment if it leaned a bit heavier on the story / character side and a bit less on the morals of it all.

Regarding the audiobook, I liked the narrator a lot. The voices were distinct and well played and made it easy to differentiate between who was talking.

All in all, 3 stars, because it isn't bad by an stretch of the imagination, it's just not balanced to my tastes. I'll let it rest a bit and see if I want to continue this series.


Disclosure: I was gifted the audiobook version by the narrator.
