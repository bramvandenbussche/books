[The Churn]() is a longer read than Drive, but it still classifies as a short story, this time providing a background story on… wait, I can’t tell you that, since it would spoil the narrative… so let’s just keep it at “more background to the main storyline” and leave it at that.

I actually enjoyed reading this one a lot more than the other shorts in the series, mostly because there’s an actual plot. Still some solid writing and the audiobook was a real treat.

4 stars.
