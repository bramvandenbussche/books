I immensely enjoyed Ready Player One. It's fast and sharp with plenty of humor to go around.

## World-building

[Ernest Cline](../_authors/ernest-cline.md) paints a grim picture of our future, but it's one that isn't that hard to fathom given the current economic and political climate. This makes it hit close to home and provides a stark background for the 80's nostalgia this book is built upon.

## Story

The story is your basic scavenger hunt, using 80's nostalgia as the guide and eventually turns into a simple black and white, good vs evil fight.

## Conclusion

Despite a simple story, this was good fun. Maybe it's my inner tech-geek that just kept geeking out to all the neat tech the future holds, but I was thoroughly entertained.
