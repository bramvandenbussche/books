Is this a masterpiece of human literature? Definitely not.
Is it hillarious from start to finish and will I continue devouring the sequels? In the "spirit" of the book, I'm gonna go with: Oh Hell Fucking Yes.

I admit, this is not for everyone, it's not deep or complicated, there's a simple plot, and apart from the main characters, there isn't anyone worth mentioning. However, if you like "Yo Momma" jokes, expletive references to shit, piss, dicks and tits, set in a fantasy universe using D&D mechanics, this book has got you covered.
