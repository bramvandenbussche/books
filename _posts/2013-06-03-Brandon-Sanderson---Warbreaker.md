I find it hard to collect my thoughts on [Warbreaker](). Which I find odd for a Sanderson book.

After the [Mistborn Trilogy](../_series/mistborn.md), [Elantris](2013-05-05-Brandon-Sanderson---Elantris.md), [The Emperor's Soul](2013-05-08-Brandon-Sanderson---The-Emperors-Soul.md)  and [The Way of Kings](2013-05-23-Brandon-Sanderson---The-Way-of-Kings.md), I know what I should expect from him.

On the surface [Warbreaker]() seems to have all the right ingrediÃ«nts for another great tale:

- Unique, vibrant world
- A magic system that resembles nothing you've ever heard of
- Mystery, intrigue on a grand scale
- Complicated take on religion and it's effects
- Interesting and exciting characters which develop during the story

And yet I found myself just waiting to be sucked in, but the moment never came. I remember reading [The Mistborn Trilogy](../_series/mistborn.md) and being hooked after only a few chapters, the same goes for [Elantris](2013-05-05-Brandon-Sanderson---Elantris.md).

I can't exactly put my finger on it, but I think for me the dealbreaker were the characters themselves. None of them were relatable to me, I didn't came to care about any of them, not like I cared for Vin or Kelsier. I think it's like someone said in one of the reviews I read:

> It feels like the characters have been written to fit the story, and not the other way around.


[Warbreaker]() is **not** an epic tale like [Mistborn](../_series/mistborn.md) or [The Way of Kings](2013-05-23-Brandon-Sanderson---The-Way-of-Kings.md). Nor is it as small-worlded as [The Emperor's Soul](). It kind of takes the middle ground in that it feels like a rather large scale, but manages to maintain focus on just a select part of the world.

In the end I can say that I liked it but unfortunately I didn't love it, the ending made up for a lot though, but I think I'm going to stick with a 3 star rating.
