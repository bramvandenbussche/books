Overall I was disappointed with this book. I had picked it up after reading some reviews about how "great" the series is supposed to be, and how lovely the first book was.

I've had this uncomfortable feeling the entire time that I was reading that there was this incredible world that was waiting to suck me in, but it never happened; The writing style mostly threw me off. Short descriptions of people / environments, constantly switching point of view didn't do the flow of the story any good.

The usage of foreign/imagenary words for things where there is a perfectly valid recognizable alternative is annoying as hell (e.g Dweomer ~ magic / Wyrd ~ fate / Gwerbreth ~ Baron / etc...) and just makes matters more complex than they need to be.

Characters felt flat and changed direction all the time, I couldn't personify with a single character in the book and the constant jumping makes it hard to recognize who the main character is supposed to be.

I've decided not to read the second book at this time and just pick up something else in stead.
