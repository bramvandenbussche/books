This is another short story in the St. Mary’s Chronicles. Chronologically it’s the first in the series, but I would not recommend to start here.

<!--more-->

I’ve completed the main works 1 through 6 and reading this feels like floating in a big bubble of nostalgia. Seeing all those familiar characters again, at a point in life where nothing has really happened yet, feels strangely warm and fuzzy. Also, as per usual, I laughed out loud on many occasions.

I should point out that the audiobook narration this time around, was performed by the author herself and, unfortunately, wasn’t up to the same standard as the other ones narrated by the excellent Zara Ramm.
