It's amazing that after 13 books and about as many short stories, this series still never fails to entertain.

<!--more-->

This installment has all the things you want from a St. Mary's book: History, plots, assassinations, time travel, snark, bickering and lots and lots of tea.

I thorougly enjoyed Max's shenanigans up and down the timeline, including the ever confusing effect-before-cause storylines.

Can't wait to find out what the "brilliant idea" is that she has at the end. 4.5 stars.
