I’m torn between 3 and 4 stars, because for some reason, this book didn’t really click for me. I find it hard to pinpoint why exactly though. It had all the ingredients to be amazing but it felt like it just didn’t hook me in. I’ll do some soulsearching and see if I can figure out why (and if i’ll pick up the second installment in the series)
