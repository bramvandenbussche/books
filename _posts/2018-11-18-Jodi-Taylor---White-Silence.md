Well this was a weird one.

<!--more-->

![I actually quite like it](/assets/content/I-actually-quite-like-it.gif)

I liked it though. I liked it a lot.

Let’s get into the nitty gritty.

## Characters

This book has all the hallmarks of a [Jodi Taylor](../authors/../_authors/jodi-taylor.md) novel and it wasn’t hard to find the parallels between the main characters here and the ones in the [St. Mary’s series](../_series/chronicles-of-st-marys.md).

Our protagonist, Elizabeth Cage, feels a lot like a slightly more boring version of Maxwell and the ‘Mountain’ Jones seems a carbon copy of Leon. Good, strong, dependable Leon.

That isn’t to say I didn’t like them. These characters felt familiar, but still novel. You could get comfortable with them quite quickly and the amazing narrator makes you feel right at home.

## Worldbuilding

As usual, the world-building is functional, with enough bells and whistles to integrate well in the story, but without getting into paragraph on paragraph of describing a particular scene.

## Story

It's a very different story from what I'm used to at St. Mary's, where everything that happens is supported by a scientific background. Here things take the more paranormal route (because just like we don't call it Time Travel, we won't call it Magic). It was a bit unexpected, but it wasn't jarring or anything. The story is part mystery, as Elizabeth explores her powers and the ~~magical~~ paranormal world around her, and part thriller as she has to come to grips with the legacy of her late husband. I quite liked it.

## Writing

What's left to say here? Jodi Taylors writing always seems to work for me, it's the combination of lightheartedness, wit and that British tone of voice/accent that really make everything she writes immediattely work for me. Wether it's thrilling adventure, a suspenseful mystery or a romantic evening on the couch, it all just works.

## Conclusion

Not a great surprise here, I very much loved my time with Elizabeth Cage and I'm gonna jump into the next one with gusto.
