My God, this was good. The first half is hard to follow and confusing, with lots of jumping back and forth. This is deliberately so, and in light of the entire experience, it can be forgiven.

Great story, great writing, some nice plot twists and some very elaborate world (universe?) building made this a very interesting story. Can't wait to read the next book.
