I think that if I would have read [Elantris]() prior to reading the [Mistborn Trilogy](../_series/mistborn.md) then I would have probably given this 5 stars. Don't get me wrong though, Elantris was really good. It was fast paced, had constant tension, superb characters and story arcs. There is a lot of plot twisting and the different characters were constantly pulling on my emotions. The only _quip_ that I have is that it just isn't on the same level of **'epicness'** as [Mistborn](../_series/mistborn.md).

Other than that, I can really recommend this for people who like a shorter read, but be prepared to be sucked in and '_live_' the story.

## Characters

I love how [Sanderson](../_authors/brandon-sanderson.md) chose to have 3 main protagonists, strongly entwined with each other and still worthy in their own right and capable of carrying the story on their own.

Apart from the main characters [Elantris]() is home to some truly memorable secondary characters.

e.g I constantly pictured the character of Galladon constantly as:

![Captain Jack Sparrow](http://bit.ly/10dwFEt)

with all his "Sule", "Doloken" and "Kolo" expressions.

The characterization of the "bad guy" is also something special and one of the things I totally didn't see coming.

Sanderson is really good at casting different characters and building their own personal story, revealing just enough at a time to keep you guessing at what's yet to come.

## Story

As per usual, Sanderson sketches a vivid world, complete with competing religions, war, rich history, alliances and  feuds. There is even some delving into the economic aspect of medieval society.

I truly love the way he incorporated religion (again) into the story, it's a vital part and the way it's woven differently into the lives of all the characters is great. I found myself pondering these things even while not reading and the different _exclaimations_ are something that sticks.

## Magic

I feel like the magic system deserves some mentioning too, as usual it's something special and it's a system that is cleverly thought out with pro's and con's. But in [Elantris]() the magic system is not 'just' a magic system, the defunct magics are a main plot device and it's nice to have this drive the plot for a change rather then just being there to facilitate things.
