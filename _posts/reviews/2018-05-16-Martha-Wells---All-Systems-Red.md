On the surface, this is a great little sci-fi novel about an AI-driven construct (half bot / half organic) working on a foreign planet, supporting a team of humans that are in over their heads.

When you dig deeper though, it poses a few interesting questions about AI sentience and living with sentient AIâ€™s. A hot topic. In stead of giving answers to these questions, or philosophizing about it, the novel just tackles them head on, in a human fashion: confusing, emotional and alien, all at the same time.

Overall well written and plenty of dry humor to go around. Definitely will pick up the next one.
