## The Crown Conspiracy (Theft of Swords I)

This was simple, clean fantasy fun. I love the two 'heroes' and the relationship between them. Everything has a rather light-hearted feel to it that actually works surprisingly well.The story itself is rather simple, a bit on the easy side, but I loved it nonetheless. It was entertaining and self-contained. It simply works.

## Avempartha (Theft of Swords II)

Avempartha picks up right after The Crown Conspiracy and is a touch heavier on the storyline without losing it's light-hearted humor and terrific characters. Very entertaining, yes.
