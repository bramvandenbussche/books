Hmmm, it always bugs me when I finish a book and have to write a review and I have no idea what to say. What did I think of the book? This only happens with books that are in somewhere between "Amazing Awesome and more" and "Oh my God this is utter shit".

There's plenty to love about The Scar, like some great writing and character building but for all the things it's got going for it, somehow I wasn't all that engrossed in the story. Some character actions just felt fake to me, <spoiler> like the sudden change Toria makes in her attitude towards Egert</spoiler>
And then there is the ending, <spoiler>with it's abrupt deus ex machina that was actually boring as all hell</spoiler>.

I really wanted to like this, but it just falls short on too many points in the story that don't really made sense to me, or maybe I just didn't get it.

Not a bad story at all, but not for me.
