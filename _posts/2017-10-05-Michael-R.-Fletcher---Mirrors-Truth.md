After finishing [Beyond Redemption](2017-09-20-Michael-Fletcher---Beyond-Redemption.md) I dove straight into [Mirror’s Truth](), because it was just that damn good.

Also, I was quite interested to see how the author was going to handle all 4 protagonists being dead at the end of the first novel, and BOY, does he handle it well. [Beyond Redemption](2017-09-20-Michael-Fletcher---Beyond-Redemption.md) was an incredible experience, with solid world building, phenominal characters and superb writing. The premise that [Michael Fletcher](../_authors/michael-r-fletcher.md) uses is an nteresting one, but he explores it to the fullest.

This is, again, one of the darkest fantasy I’ve ever read, even topping [Beyond Redemption](2017-09-20-Michael-Fletcher---Beyond-Redemption.md) by taking it just a bit further. We get the same amazing cast as the first book and follow them on their individual paths.
