I like this book a lot better than the previous one, mostly because it's non-stop action from page 1 whereas the previous one was a bit more of a struggle (one to get throught the first half).

I love how Sanderson tells an intricated, twisting story and manages to implement deep political and theological themes into the story. There is a lot of moralizing, but it happens ever so gently, from an outsiders point of view and it lets you form your own opinion on them.

## The Awesome bits

- Great character development in general
- 
> “There has to be a balance, Vin. Somehow, we’ll find it. The balance between whom we wish to be and whom we need to be. But for now, we simply have to be satisfied with who we are.”

- Spooks is finally evolving and getting the attention he deserves
- Sazeds brooding seems to delve deep into religious doctrines and theological discussions and him eventually hitting rock bottom really hit it home for me
<spoiler>It was pain. That’s what the loss felt like. Pain and numbness at the same time; a barb-covered wire twisting around his chest combined with an absolute inability to do anything about it. He felt like huddling in a corner, crying, and just letting himself die.</spoiler>
- Non stop action from the first page
- Less overstretched political rambling
- Some more complex side-effects of rebellions / overthrowing governments are nicely woven into the narrative but not overdone
- Development of Kandra lore
- Development of Kolos lore
- The last paragraphs of each chapter, a story in itself, that are slowly tying up ends from the previous books and that constantly keep me wanting more
- Sandersons take on good vs. evil
- The way this book constantly seems like it's throwing hints at you about what is going to happen, yet it constantly keeps surprising me with new plot twists up until the very end
- The way the whole story wraps up in the end, connecting every loose story line
- The bittersweet ending that leaves you joyfull and sad at the same time
- The epicness of the entire story arc. When it finally unfolds and you see the complete picture for the first time, I couldn't help but being awed. This, for me, proves the mastery that is Brandon Sanderson and it makes him one of the best writers of this time I think.
