Another delightful little short story from the St. Mary’s nutcases. This time with a wonderful Christmas feel-good atmosphere and some much needed mother/son bonding time to boot.

As always, the writing and humor are the same level I expect from Jodi Taylor, and I’m very happy that for once she didn’t rip my heart out and stomped on it, instead focusing on some much needed healing. Very short, but entertaining nonetheless.

4 stars for warming this old cynics heart, but not amazing either.
