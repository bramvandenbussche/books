I felt that this book meandered on for way to long without a clear direction in sight. It wasn't until the very last chapters that you got a feeling of where this book was heading, and I didn't care for it.

Other than that, it's another romp of our beloved idiots, behaving like lunatics while being badass and getting from problem to problem with the roll of a dice. There were plenty of farts and plenty of swearing to keep me going until the next installment comes around. 3.5 stars.
