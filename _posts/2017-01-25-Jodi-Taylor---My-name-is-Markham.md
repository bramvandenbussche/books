What is there to say? It’s St. Mary’s as we know it. It’s the 14th book in the series, and after all this time, it feels like coming home. The characters I know and love are there, the humor and writing is on point as always, and they muck about history as usual. Seeing Markhams side of things is a nice change of pace.

I do prefer Zara Ramm doing the narrating (Audiobook purchased from Audible), but that doesn’t detract from the great fun this was.
